# Electronics eCommerce Shop With Admin Dashboard in Next.js and Node.js

This is my personal adaptation of an electronics eCommerce shop built using Next.js and Node.js. I have redesigned and customized the application from scratch, adding my own features and improvements to create a modern, fully responsive online store. The project demonstrates a full-stack implementation with a complete admin dashboard, product management, and user management system. 

Key features of this project include:

- Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile devices
- Fully functional admin dashboard for managing products, categories, users, and orders
- User authentication and authorization
- Shopping cart, wishlist, and checkout system
- Integration with MySQL database for data storage
- Clear project structure for both frontend and backend
- Sample demo data for testing and experimentation
